# Composite Agent Runtime Environment (CARE)


**A framework for building, packaging, deploying, and orchestrating stateful AI agents**

## üß† What is CARE?

The Composite Agent Runtime Environment (CARE) is an open-source framework for creating self-contained, portable AI agent ecosystems. CARE treats AI agents like containerized applications - they can be versioned, shared, composed into workflows, and migrated between environments while preserving their state.

Our mission is to create a standard that enables AI agents to be built once and run anywhere, with seamless composition, state preservation, and resource sharing.

## üîë Key Concepts

- **Agent Bundles**: Self-contained packages including agent definition, tools, knowledge, and optionally models
- **Stateful Agents**: Checkpoint, resume, and transfer running agents with memory intact
- **Agent Orchestration**: Create complex workflows with multiple specialized agents
- **Shared Resources**: Efficiently share tools, documents, and models between agents
- **Portable Runtime**: Run the same agent bundle across different environments

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

- **Agent Portability**: Package agents to run consistently across development, testing, and production
- **Stateful Migration**: Move agents between environments without losing context or memory
- **Team Collaboration**: Share agents with predictable behavior across development teams  
- **Composite Workflows**: Build complex agent systems from simpler, specialized components
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently share tools and knowledge across multiple agents

## üì¶ Getting Started

```bash
# Install the CARE CLI
npm install -g care-cli

# Create a new agent bundle
care init my-first-agent

# Run your agent
care run my-first-agent

# Create an agent checkpoint
care checkpoint my-first-agent --output my-agent.state

# Resume from checkpoint
care resume --from my-agent.state
```
